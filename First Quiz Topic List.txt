python
	list basics - lists are dynamic
	defining a function
	if statements, for loops, variables
	running python from command line (python3 name.py)	

cmd line
	difference between stdin v. command line args
	know how to do both of the above types of input
	cat, less, vim - viewing file contents
	cd, ls, clear, q (quit with catting or in vim), rm
	grep - search for a pattern in a file
	python3 - launches interactive interpreter 
	bash	
		pipe (|) - sends stdout from one program/cmd to stdin of another
		redirect (>) - sends stdout from prog/cmd into file

neural nets - 3b1b videos
	cost function
		way to perform how bad NN performed on batch or single example
		RSME 
	*back-prop 
		used to minimize cost function of NN by going from output layer to first layer and adjusting weights
		happens after computing cost for (one batch of training examples or a single example - single example is extremely computationally expensive)  	
		application of grad descent to the network 
	activation function
		purpose - squishifying the weighted sum from previous layer  
		introduces non-linearalities into model, turns NN from LR to actual deep learning		
		sigmoid - squishes nums between -1 and 1
		RELU - 
	*grad descent 
		determining set of changes to weights to minimize cost
	overfitting v. underfitting

quiz focus is on NNs

Study Plan:
1. do 3-5 coding bat pratice problems (DONE)
2. pratice cmd line with dad (and also python number examples and stuff) 
3. rewatch 3b1b vids and take notes
4. reread first chapter of ml book
